            <h2>Helping to deliver best search experience</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a UX designer with background in software development.
                The knowledge of how things work under the hood helps me to deliver better user experience
                and avoid pitfalls which reveal on a design implementation phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the last 4 years I’ve been focused on search technologies and search-driven applications.
                My vision of search can be perfectly described by Donald Rumsfeld's quote:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                “Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know,
                there are <b>known knowns</b>; there are things we know we know. We also know there are <b>known unknowns</b>;
                that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also <b>unknown unknowns</b> –
                the ones we don't know we don't know.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I am working on all these directions helping people to find known knowns (navigation),
                known unknowns (search by cretiria) and unknown unknowns (discovery).
            </p>
            <p>
                In a working process I highly value two basic principles: <b>'keep things simple'</b> and <b>'there is no way
                to overcommunicate'</b>.  I am always happy to work directly with customers and users to make the process
                transparent and avoid sudden issues.

                        analyzing on engineering data sets
                    </h2>

                    <p>Inforbix is a startup founded in 2010 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olegshilovitsky/en">Oleg Shilovitsky</a> and <a href="https://ru.linkedin.com/in/anatolysavin/en">Anatoly Savin</a> and <a href="http://beyondplm.com/2012/08/28/autodesk-acquires-inforbix-and-message-to-my-readers/">acquired by Autodesk</a> in 2012. Inforbix developed cloud-based product data applications which goal was to revolutionize the way engineers and all people in manufacturing companies are working with product data.</p>
                    <p>Inforbix applications provide engineers with possibilities to perform search and analytics on unstructured engineering data. Simple mechanism for importing data helps to start working with a service immediately without wasting time on schema creation, manual data importing or setting up mapping of existent data into index.</p>
                    <p>The paradigm of Inforbix apps was that everything is a search. Whatever you do, looking for a data, making analytics with table or charts, everything is based on search queries.</p>
                    <p>I participated in this project as Frontend Teamleader at <a href="http://maginfo.com">Maginfo company</a> (owned by Anatoly Savin) which developed Inforbix infrastructure. My UX-design goals were:</p>

                    <div class="goals">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design Charts and Dashboard applications;</li>
                            <li>Help users to become Familiar with all search approaches which Inforbix Search provides to engineers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>
                        Design Charts and Dashboard applications
                    </h2>

                    <p>When I joined Inforbix team, Search and Tables apps were already created as well as design guidelines for a product which I used during my work.</p>
                    <p>According to a search hierarchy of needs, users which are satisfied with data searching would like to use search results for analytics. Search and Tables Inforbix apps were starting points which helped to create subsets of data using query mechanism. My goal was to help users to visualize search queries results and make them suitable for analytics.</p>
                    <p>Spreadsheet applications taught us that if you can make a table you are also able to make a chart by its data. This is how the idea of charts appeared.</p>

                    <img src="img/inforbix/web/charts-mockup.png">

                    <p>Wireframes were accepted and after applying Inforbix design guidelines final charts interface looked like this:</p>

                    <img src="img/inforbix/web/charts.png">

                    <p>After researches we got feedback that users want to combine results of existent applications in a single place. Some kind of dashboard. This definition was turned into a new app named Dashboard.</p>

                    <img src="img/inforbix/web/dashboard.png">

                        Help users to become Familiar with all search approaches which Inforbix Search provides to engineers
                    </h2>

                    <p>Engineering domain has its own specific which makes classic search approaches not very efficient on it. As Inforbix search provides capability not only to perform fulltext search by file names but also deep search by all attributes of internal structures as well as search by references, it was an important task how to help users to get familiar with all search possibilities they have.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes search string confused users as they didn’t know what to type in it. It wasn’t evident that a user can search by specific field like “author” for example. Also, it wasn’t evident that all the indexed data has a category mark which identifies its nature (Excel Spreadsheet, Inventor Document, etc.).</p>
                    <p>The solution was a special entrance page which contained a list of all applications and search templates. With the help of these templates a new user can easily make efficient search queries.</p>

                        <h2>Define functionality and design</h2>
                        <p>The idea of mobile application was to provide simple to use, every-day search functionality. Inforbix Search was chosen as a starting point for my research.</p>
                        <p>According to investigations, basic needs were mostly satisfied with fulltext search and navigation between relationships. As for filtering category and timeline, they were highlighted as most frequently used.</p>

                        <img src="img/inforbix/ipad/search.png">

                        <p>Candidate for removing was a filter by exact property value as it was too complicated to use on mobile device. To satisfy users which may need this function we leaved possibility to make such a search request with the help of saved searches. User can define necessary search queries using web applications, save them and then use on mobile device.</p>

                        <img src="img/inforbix/ipad/saved.png">

                        <p>We also noticed that there can be difficult situations while searching for some engineering part or document: user knows how it looks like, user knows some of its properties or both variants. As a results we introduced three possible item views: rendering-centric, attributes-centric and combined one.</p>

                        <img src="img/inforbix/ipad/attributes.png">

                        <p>Good thing of mobile device is that you can take it with yourself. Sometimes it can turn out that there is no internet connection but you need to to get necessary information about some design. That’s why we’ve introduced “favorites” functionality on iPad app. User can add search result to favorites and it will be saved for offline usage.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Solve issue with misunderstanding which search criteria were applied;</li>
                            <li>Solve issue with inefficient space usage in Inforbix search results;</li>
                            <li>Redesign Inforbix search and integrate into A360 infrastructure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Solve issue with misunderstanding which search criteria where applied</h2>

                    <p>One of the problems of previous Inforbix search interface was that search criteria was cluttered and described in multiple places: search term in search input, category filters and property filters in their own places. As a result, user could miss some of criteria and could be confused by a result set.</p>
                    <p>To solve this issue I suggested an approach of search input pills, so all the criteria would be kept in one single place.</p>

                    <h2>Solve issue with inefficient space usage in Inforbix search results</h2>

                    <p>Original Inforbix search results took most of the page which made them not quite effective in representing result set especially when user wanted to see search snippet details. The suggested idea was to split result list into two parts - first to a list of result items and second to a rich snippet representation.</p>

                    <h2>Redesign Inforbix search and integrate into A360 infrastructure</h2>

                    <p>Combining all above fixes with restructuring search applications into widgets provided the following widget design.</p>
